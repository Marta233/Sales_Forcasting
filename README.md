# Sales Forecasting Project

This project implements a sales forecasting solution using machine learning techniques, specifically a Random Forest model. Initially, an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model was explored, but it did not yield satisfactory results, prompting a shift to the more robust Random Forest algorithm. This project also includes the development of a FastAPI for serving predictions.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to accurately predict future sales based on historical data. The Random Forest model was chosen for its performance and interpretability. This solution includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation steps, and it serves as a foundation for further improvements and refinements.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- joblib
- FastAPI
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (for experimentation)

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-forecasting.git
   cd sales-forecasting
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preparation:

Place your sales data in the designated directory. The script is designed to load and preprocess the data automatically.
Model Training:

Run the train_model.py script to preprocess the data and fit the Random Forest model.
bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Making Predictions:

Use the TestSalesForecasting class to make predictions on new test data. Ensure your test data follows the same preprocessing steps as the training data.
Starting the API:

Run the FastAPI application:
bash
Copy code
uvicorn app:app --reload
The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Model Details
Model Type: Random Forest
Evaluation Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² score.
Feature Importance Visualization: The model includes a feature importance analysis to understand which features most significantly impact sales predictions.
